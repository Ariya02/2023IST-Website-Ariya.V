<h1>Fennec Fox</h1>
<P>Fennec Foxes, also known as Vulpes zerda,
are animals native to North African deserts. 
Their habitats are located throughout the Sahara Desert and prefer sandy desert resgions with desert grasses or 
scrub vegetation. Fennec Foxes do not pose any major threat to people
or livestock however, they are important to control locusts and rodent populations.
They are nocturnal creatures that avoid daytime heat of the dry desert environment and 
with the help of their bat-like ears, they stay cool. They also stay warm with an undercoat that
insulates them during cold desrt nights which are also used as protection from the 
daytime sun.</P>

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<P> Fennec Foxes weigh around 0.68kg to 1.6kg with a 
height of 20cm. Their life span averages to 10 to 12 years. Most of them are cream coloured with black-tipped tails
and have the largest ears of any member of the canid family (up to 6 inches),
relative to their small size. They are omnivores, eating insects such 
as grasshoppers and locusts as well as small rodents, lizards, snails,
birds and plant matter. These foxes dwell in small groups of up to 10 and live in burrows. </P>

<h2>Population Risks</h2>
<P>Despite not being endangered, Fennec Foxes are often hunted by owls (Verreaux's eagle owl), jackals and other mammals.
The main threat to these foxes are humans, trapping them for exhibition or sale to tourists in North 
Africa. There is also a high risk of road kill in developed areas.</P>
